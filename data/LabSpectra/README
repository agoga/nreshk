Welcome,

This subdirectory contains a solar spectral atlas obtained with
the Fourier Transform Spectrometer at the McMath/Pierce Solar Telescope
situated on Kitt Peak, Arizona, and operated by the National Solar
Observatory, a Division of the National Optical Astronomy Observatories.
NOAO is adminsitered by the Association of Univiersities for Research in
Astronomy, Inc., under cooperative agreement with the National Science
Foundation.

This version of ``Solar Flux Atlas from 296 to 1300 nm'' by Robert L.
Kurucz, Ingemar Furenlid, James Brault, and Larry Testerman, (National Solar 
Observatory Atlas No. 1, June 1984), is meant to be used in conjunction with 
the original hard-copy version, and the caveats in the text of that version 
apply here equally.

The spectrum on pages 47 to 238 of the original is contained in ascii files
covering 4 nm plus 0.1 nm of overlap on the high wavelength end.  
Each file is given the name ``lmxxxx'' where xxxx is the wavelength of the 
beginning of the main 4 nm of the segment.  Thus, lm0872 contains the material
from 872.0 to 876.1 nm. The first column contains the wavelength in air, 
the second column contains the pseudo-residual flux, and the third column 
contains the corresponding observed irradiance in units of micro-watts per 
square centimeter per nanometer. Refer to the hard-copy for details of the 
irradiance calibration. One micro-watt is 10 ergs/sec. For flux in ergs per 
square sm per second per nanometer at the solar surface, multiply the 
irradiance by 10*(1.495985e13/6.9598e10)**2=462020. For astrophysical flux F 
divide the surface flux by pi (3.14159). For flux moment H divide the surface 
flux by 4 pi.

The digital source of the spectrum was a 9-track 1600 BPI tape
containing the spectrum on two different wavelength grids. The data provided
at this ftp site is on the original unevenly-spaced grid.
