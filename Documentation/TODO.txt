Try catch around single observations as well as stars to allow for large data sets to be processed despite potential errors.

Old spectra format from NRES may not be running both observations. THIS IS DUE TO TWO OBS PER FOLDER 

check calc_shk is using windows function properly, may be accessing array wrong.

set up optional radial velocity shifting(if statement to ignore cross-corr align)
DOCUMENT THIS

better documentation for alpha value and alignment detect function

move functions around for files, hk_windows,

swap code and output to angstroms

Investigate and tweek bad detection settings. Find simple star with knwon good and bad data to decide on specific values for auto-correlation.
