DONT DELETE ITEMS, USE FIXED FOR FEATURE LIST

epi eri is bad test star, reversal ruins windowed shifting

Lab spec in intermediate plot is broken somehow

NOT DOING THIS-swap code and output to angstroms

FIXED-remove idl remenants and other obsolete code/variables

once folder order set, place functions on top for easy finding

cofirm that we should always use filename for star over the star name from fits header

FIXED Convolutions take the most time(outside of plotting)

FIXED-Easy to use plot function to take this pipeline data and print it with other data

Try catch around single observations as well as stars to allow for large data sets to be processed despite potential errors.

FIXED Old spectra format from NRES may not be running both observations. THIS IS DUE TO TWO OBS PER FOLDER 

I BELIEVE FINE check calc_shk is using windows function properly, may be accessing array wrong.

MOSTLY FIXED, TEST NEEDED set up optional radial velocity shifting(if statement to ignore cross-corr align)
DOCUMENT THIS

SEMI FIXEDSTORE A STARS BAD DATA FILE AND SKIP IT NEXT re-RUN


FIXED change all array shapes to python style to remove transpose

In making the flat we use the lamda range of 380-420 but it seems like we are using significantly less.

FIXED - better documentation for alpha value and

FIXED - changed mk_flatolap bounds for each order. This decides how much of each order the flat takes and adds.
It used to have different values for each order but they were hacked in. Now I used roughly the lowest and highest
from the original lists for all orders. Seems the have normal flats.

make pipeline callable on remote server

create function to load data that comes from np.savez NRES_SHK_Pipeline.py


******window alignment functionality*****

Investigate and tweek bad detection settings. Find simple star with knwon good and bad data to decide on specific values for auto-correlation.
