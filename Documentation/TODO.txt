DONT DELETE ITEMS, USE FIXED FOR FEATURE LIST

NOT DOING THIS-swap code and output to angstroms

FIXED-remove idl remenants and other obsolete code/variables

once folder order set, place functions on top for easy finding

cofirm that we should always use filename for star over the star name from fits header

Convolutions take the most time(outside of plotting)

FIXED-Easy to use plot function to take this pipeline data and print it with other data

Try catch around single observations as well as stars to allow for large data sets to be processed despite potential errors.

FIXED? Old spectra format from NRES may not be running both observations. THIS IS DUE TO TWO OBS PER FOLDER 

check calc_shk is using windows function properly, may be accessing array wrong.

set up optional radial velocity shifting(if statement to ignore cross-corr align)
DOCUMENT THIS

STORE A STARS BAD DATA FILE AND SKIP IT NEXT re-RUN


FIX THIS AND ALL ARRAY SHAPES TO FOLLOW PYTHON LOADING


FIXED - better documentation for alpha value and


make pipeline callable on remote server

create function to load data that comes from np.savez NRES_SHK_Pipeline.py


******window alignment functionality*****

Investigate and tweek bad detection settings. Find simple star with knwon good and bad data to decide on specific values for auto-correlation.
