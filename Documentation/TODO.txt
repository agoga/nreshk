swap code and output to angstroms

once folder order set, place functions on top for easy finding


create function to load data that comes from np.savez NRES_SHK_Pipeline.py

Try catch around single observations as well as stars to allow for large data sets to be processed despite potential errors.

Old spectra format from NRES may not be running both observations. THIS IS DUE TO TWO OBS PER FOLDER 

check calc_shk is using windows function properly, may be accessing array wrong.

set up optional radial velocity shifting(if statement to ignore cross-corr align)
DOCUMENT THIS

STORE A STARS BAD DATA FILE AND SKIP IT NEXT re-RUN

better documentation for alpha value and
alignment detect function


Investigate and tweek bad detection settings. Find simple star with knwon good and bad data to decide on specific values for auto-correlation.
